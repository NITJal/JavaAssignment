Q. Write a java program to simulate traffic signal using mutithreading concepts. 
The light sequence is:
Green: safe to cross. [1 minutes]
Yellow or orange: continue to cross only if unable to stop safely. [50 sec]
Flashing yellow or orange: cross with caution (often used when lights are out of order or shut down). [40 sec]
Red: do not cross.[1 minutes]

[Hint: Use Synchronization and create a new thread corresponding to each signal]

Q. Bob want to withdraw 20000 rupees from his account. Currently account contains 5000 rupees. 
So he called Alice to deposit 15000 in his account.
Whenever a withdraw request is made, the system must check whether balance is sufficient or not. 
If balance is sufficient then the system will deduce the amount from original balance otherwise it will wait for deposit.
Create two threads deposit and withdraw to solve this problem. After each transaction show the balance.
[Hint: Inter-thread communication]
