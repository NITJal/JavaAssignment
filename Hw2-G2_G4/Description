Problem 1: Pogo is trying to build a calculator which can solve boolean problems with "AND" and "OR" operators. 
Help her to make the code to evaluate boolean expressions.

Sample Input: 
String as input: (True OR False OR (True AND True))

Sample Output:
boolean output: True             

Note: You need to implement the following interface in your code

interface booleanExpression
{
  public boolean EvaluateExpression(String s);

}


Problem 2. Write a program to print all 4 letter permutations of the string "AACE" in lexicographical order. 

Problem 3. Write a program to print all possible words [1 length, 2 length, 3 length and 4 length] that can be formed from 
the letters of the string "AACE" in lexicographical order. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If any two codes are same then both will be rejected.
